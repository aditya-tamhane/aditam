# Intro

Currently spearheading my own venture, Aditya 360°, where I channel my expertise as a Google Business Specialist to elevate businesses' online presence with cutting-edge 360° Virtual Tours and strategic SEO. Previously, I honed my skills as a Digital Insights & Big Data Analytics Intern at Hitachi Vantara, where I delved deep into the world of data. As an Information Technology graduate from NMIET, Pune, I thrive on the excitement technology brings and the transformative impact it has on our world.

I’ve built a solid foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (C++), Web Development (NodeJs, MySQL), and Data Analytics (Tableau). What I may lack in experience, I more than make up for with relentless curiosity and a determination to learn. When I'm not immersed in tech, you’ll find me dominating the Table Tennis table or expressing my creativity through drawing. I'm eager to bring my fresh perspective and innovative ideas to a forward-thinking company that values growth and embraces change.

# Some history

- In the summer of 2007, I had my first encounter with the tech world through a [Nokia 3110](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3110_classic) mobile phone, discovering its built-in apps and games.

- At 9, my first hands-on computer experience unfolded at school.

- At 12, I mastered the basics of computers through school, ready for the tech journey ahead.

- At 14, I developed a passion for computer systems, indulging in some school computer mischief and creating projects with newfound tech skills.

- At 16, I delved into coding, writing my first lines on [Turbo C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_C%2B%2B), exploring the world of programming.

- From 16 to 18, I stepped away from the computer world, focusing on my 11th and 12th studies, not much to tell about these days.

- At 19, destiny led me back to the techy world through admission to Pune University, where I said "Hola" to the IT field.

- At the start of my final year, I secured four job offers and was primarily engaged in working at a company.

- In 2023, I graduated with first-class distinction, showcasing my semester projects, final year project, and publishing my debut academic paper.

- In 2024, I founded Aditya 360°, a platform empowering businesses to dominate local search with expert Google Business Profile management, captivating 360° virtual tours, and result-driven local SEO.
