# Intro

Worked as a Digital Insights & Big Data Analytics Intern at [Hitachi Vantara](https://www.hitachivantara.com/en-us/home.html). I am an Information Technology graduate from [NMIET](https://www.nmiet.edu.in/), Pune. Technology excites me and I am always in awe of the change it drives in the world. Certain skills that I have worked with include Data Structures and Algorithms (C++), Web Development (NodeJs, MySQL) & Data Analytics (with Tableau). And what I might lack in skills I make up for with my determination to learn. Outside of tech, I'm an avid Table Tennis enthusiast and a drawing artist. I am excited to bring my fresh perspective and innovative ideas to a dynamic company that values growth and embraces change.

# Some history

- In the summer of 2007, I had my first encounter with the tech world through a [Nokia 3110](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3110_classic) mobile phone, discovering its built-in apps and games.

- At 9, my first hands-on computer experience unfolded at school.

- At 12, I mastered the basics of computers through school, ready for the tech journey ahead.

- At 14, I developed a passion for computer systems, indulging in some school computer mischief and creating projects with newfound tech skills.

- At 16, I delved into coding, writing my first lines on [Turbo C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_C%2B%2B), exploring the world of programming.

- From 16 to 18, I stepped away from the computer world, focusing on my 11th and 12th studies, not much to tell about these days.

- At 19, destiny led me back to the techy world through admission to Pune University, where I said "Hola" to the IT field.

- At the start of my final year, I secured four job offers and was primarily engaged in working at a company.

- In 2023, amid the IT industry recession, I graduated with first-class distinction, showcasing my semester projects, final year project, and publishing my debut academic paper.

- Currently, I find myself in a situation where my company has laid off several freshers, including me. I am now actively searching for a new job - a gateway back into the techy world that I am passionate about.

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
